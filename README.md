# Autodetectify

Welcome to **Autodetectify**, an advanced solution for for testing Zero-Shot(ZS) object detection models with different 
prompts and autolabelling datasets. This application provides a modern interface for comparing different object 
detection prompts on your uploaded images, auto-labeling images based on your specified prompt, and 
exporting the dataset in various formats.

## Features

- **Prompt Comparison**: Upload your images, enter different prompts, and visualize side-by-side comparisons of object detection results.
- **Auto-Labeling and Export**: Automatically label your images using a specified prompt and download the labeled dataset in YOLOv5, YOLOv8, or COCO format.

## How to Use

### Prompt Comparison
